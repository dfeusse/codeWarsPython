'''
Given an array of integers of any length, return an array that has 1 added to the value 
represented by the array.

For example an array [2, 3, 9] equals 239, add one would return an array [2, 4, 0].

[4, 3, 2, 5] would return [4, 3, 2, 6]

Only positive, single digit integers are allowed in the array so the function should return null 
if any of the array values are negative or more than 10

[1, -9] would return null/nil/None (according to the language implemented).
